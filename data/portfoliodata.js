      "This project was a front-end challenge from Frontend Mentor. It's a platform that enables you to practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at different screen sizes. Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve real-world coding problems. I've learned something new with each project, helping me to improve and adapt my style.",

Some features available in this project include dynamic content management systems, Webflow animations, and a place for clients to handle content editing after initial setup of the website.",
    projBackground:
      "This website was created for the three-day summit event by Hyperfast hosted in Boca Raton, FL. Hyperfast is a business hosted under the Optime Realty umbrella, which also includes Keri Shull Team. The goal was to create a website for coaching clients to navigate to after scanning a QR code to read speaker bios and see the daily schedule. This product was especially useful after the initial build on Webflow allowing clients to make quick changes to pictures, copy, and links on the fly, without a need to use a service like GitHub.",

      "The idea behind Scoot is something everyone wants in an urban environment; Quick and efficient, easy to access, and at low-cost. The challenge is getting that idea across effectively. I decided it was best to build this project with React. I could cut down on code and add Styled Components and Framer Motion into the mix to keep users engaged with animations and colors that represent speed.

The Movie Database (TMDB) API is similar to IDMB but instead presents a free version to access an array of public movie poster and forms of data pertaining to movies. Most of the challenge comes from proper implementation of pulling data into your React app as  the rows in place are generated by basic components implementation.",
